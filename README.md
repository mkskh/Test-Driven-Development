# Test-Driven-Development

You are an inmate in Germany's prison. You cannot wait to leave and you have tried to do everything possible to break out. Nothing worked so far, but today you have finally been able to break into the prison's cleaning robot main harddrive and you are now able to reprogram it.

The robot only visits your room once a day and you then need to change its programming. You really want to make sure that your program will work well, so you want to make sure to use test-driven development for writing the program.
